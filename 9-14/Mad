I 15 a walk around the 11
To ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
But I 13 the 11 float
To the 17 18 of the 16

I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah

I 13 the 11 float
To the 17 18 of the 16
After all I knew it had to be
Something to do with you
I really don’t mind what happens now and then
As long as you’ll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still
Call me 9
If I’m alive and well, will you be
There a-holding my 14
I’ll keep you by my 18
With my superhuman might
12

You called me strong, you called me weak,
But still your secrets I will keep
You 15 for granted all the times
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head,
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still
Call me 9
If I’m alive and well,
Will you be there a-holding my 14
I’ll keep you by my 18
With my superhuman might
12

If I go crazy then will you still
Call me 9
If I’m alive and well, will you be there
Holding my 14
I’ll keep you by my 18
With my superhuman might
12
Yeah!!

If I go crazy then will you still
Call me 9
If I'm alive and well,
Will you be there a-holding my 14
I'll keep you by my 18
With my superhuman might
12
